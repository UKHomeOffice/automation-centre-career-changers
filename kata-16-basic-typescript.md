# Kata 16 - Basic JavaScript

## Overview

Building from the fundamentals of HTML and CSS learned in the previous kata, this kata focuses on the basics of TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web, enabling interactive web pages and applications, where as TypeScript adds static types to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

We will build from this in the future katas when we introduce React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

You will find that TypeScript is very similar to C# in terms of syntax and structure, making it easier for you to pick up.
