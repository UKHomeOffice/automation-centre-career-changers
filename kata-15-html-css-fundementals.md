# Kata 15 - HTML & CSS Fundamentals

## Overview

This kata focuses on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, essential technologies for building web pages. You will learn how to structure content using HTML and style it with CSS.

## Objectives

Complete the three courses on Pluralsight to gain a solid understanding of HTML and CSS which we will then build upon with React in later katas.

The best way to complete this is to have Pluralsight open on another monitor / POISE Device so you can follow along with the videos and complete the exercises as you go inside Visual Studio Code.
